# Marvel Characters

This project shows the list of all Marvel characters and their appearances in comis and series.

## Tools info ℹ️

- Xcode 13
- Swift 5.5
- MVVM
- Swift Package Manager

## Libreries with SPM 🛠️
I have managed the external libraries with SPM, much cleaner and faster than with CocoaPods.
- Alamofire 5.4.4
- Kingfisher 6.3.0

## Design pattern ⌨

The design pattern used is MVVM with dependency injection.


## Interface 📱

The user interface is very simple since I decided to spend more time in the code and structure.

I have implemented CompositionalLayout introduced in iOS13.

There are NSLocalizedString functions but I have not translated the app as it is a demo.
